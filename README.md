# Binary Upload Boom
This is a very basic social media full stack web application. You can create an account, create posts, make comments,
as well as like other posts. 



## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Express, Multer, Cloudinary

The server is made using Express.js, using Multer and Cloudinary to handle photo file uploads. It utilizes multiple models, one for Users, Posts, and Comments, and uses Mongoose to be the interface with MongoDB. 

## Optimizations

Other than making it look better, I would improve the logic behind likes, as well as add the ability to reference other
posts in the post

## Lessons Learned:

I got a better understanding of using Multer as well as Cloudinary to upload and serve images quickly and easily, as well as using the local passport stategy for authentification.
